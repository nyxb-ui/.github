Yes, we are building Nyxb UI to make your work easier. Inspired by the amazing [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) and [MagicUI](https://github.com/magicuidesign/magicui), we aim to create a comprehensive UI library that combines the best of both worlds. Our journey started with a simple idea and has grown into a library with over **150+ components** and counting! 🌟

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of Nyxb UI and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) is great but missing some features we needed.
- [MagicUI](https://github.com/magicuidesign/magicui) has fantastic components but lacks a CLI.
- We fused both together and added our own components to create a powerful library.

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://github.com/nyxb-ui/ui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 🛠️ Our Project

We develop and maintain 🧙‍♂️ Nyxb UI:

- [Nyxb UI](https://github.com/nyxb-ui/ui) - The core library of Nyxb UI 💜
- [Nyxb CLI](https://github.com/nyxb-ui/ui/blob/main/packages/cli/README.md) - The command line tool for Nyxb UI 🛠️
